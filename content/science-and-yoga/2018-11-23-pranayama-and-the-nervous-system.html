<p>Pranayama is a conscious breathing movement in which inhales and exhales are slowed and controlled. Pranayama accompanies asanas, or poses, in Vinyasa yoga. Pranayama usually occurs in 3 stages: inhale, retention (holding the breath), and exhale. In a vinyasa yoga session, each movement is purposefully accompanied with one or more of these stages.</p>
<p>Pranayama and slow breathing exercises have been found to decrease heart rate (<a href="https://search.proquest.com/openview/9b98ccfa3b77e8dc6667b20e1ca0f96c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=37533">Pal &amp; Velkumary (2004)</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C19&amp;q=Autonomic+responses+to+breath+holding+and+its+variations+following+pranayama.&amp;btnG=">Bhargava, Gogate, &amp; Mascarenhas (1988)</a>). It has also been shown to decrease blood pressure (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C19&amp;q=Autonomic+responses+to+breath+holding+and+its+variations+following+pranayama.&amp;btnG=">Bhargava, Gogate, &amp; Mascarenhas (1988)</a>).</p>
<p>It is believed that this breathing decreases sympathetic activity by increasing blood oxygenation. This was found during a study investigating pranayama during hypoxia (<a href="https://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Abstract/2001/05000/Breathing_patterns_and_cardiovascular_autonomic.16.aspx">Bernardi et al.Â (2001)</a>). This increase in oxygenation improves autonomic functioning (<a href="http://www.libraryofyoga.com/handle/123456789/45">Telles, Desiraju (1991)</a>).</p>
