My name is Lauryn Burleigh. I prefer to go by L or Burleigh and use any pronoun. I am the creator of the Between The Lobes site. I'm a big animal person. I have a Border-Collie/Lab mix named Roxy and an American Pitbull Terrier named Bronson, an American Staffordshire Terrier named Tina, and a bearded dragon named Severus. I also have two rabbits, Cal and Moo. 

I began my graduate career in Dr. Steven Greening’s Cognitive Neuroscience of Affect and Psychopathology Lab (CNAPs Lab) at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, LA and more recently joined Dr. Chris Cox's ReLearn Lab, also at LSU. I am interested in emotions and how they impact cognitive processes. My main research at the moment investigates the neural mechanisms of fear during imagination and perception. I also have a strong interest in meditation, computational neuroscience, and functional connectivity.

I completed my undergraduate training the University of New Orleans (UNO) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. At UNO, I worked under Dr. Elliott Beaton studying the brain and behaviors of children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Through my courses and working in research labs, I discovered my interest in the workings of the brain and its relation to cognition and emotion.
I joined Dr. Greening’s lab as a graduate student in August 2016 to further my understanding and research of the human brain using neuroimaging techniques and Dr. Cox's lab in August 2020 to continue my research at LSU and further my computational and modeling skills.

The software I use includes, but is not limited to: Python, bash, fsl, R, Matlab, and Overleaf (LaTex).

I am currently particularly interested in: Bayesian statistics, Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis, traditional machine learning and transfer learning, and functional connectivity in fMRI data.

Otherwise, I enjoy yoga and am a certified yoga instructor. I also like to spend my [limited] spare time camping and hiking with my pups and dragon, or doing various crafts!
