My name is Lauryn Burleigh. I am the creator of the Between The Lobes site. I have a Border-Collie/Lab mix named Roxy and an American Pitbull Terrier named Bronson, who are both pictured above. I also have two rabbits, Cal and Moo. 

I am a graduate student in Dr. Steven Greening’s Cognitive Neuroscience of Affect and Psychopathology Lab (CNAPs Lab) at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. I am interested in emotions and how they impact cognitive processes. My main research at the moment investigates the neural mechanisms of fear during imagination and perception. I also have a strong interest in meditation, computational neuroscience, and functional connectivity.

I completed my undergraduate training the University of New Orleans (UNO) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. At UNO, I worked under Dr. Elliott Beaton studying the brain and behaviors of children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Through my courses and working in research labs, I discovered my interest in the workings of the brain and its relation to cognition and emotion.
I joined Dr. Greening’s lab as a graduate student in August 2016 to further my understanding and research of the human brain using neuroimaging techniques.

The software I use includes, but is not limited to: Python, bash, fsl, R, Matlab, and Overleaf (LaTex).

I am currently particularly interested in: Bayesian statistics, Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis, and functional connectivity in fMRI data.

Otherwise, I enjoy yoga and am a certified yoga instructor. I also like to spend my [limited] spare time camping and hiking with my pups!
