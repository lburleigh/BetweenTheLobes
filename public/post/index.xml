My name is Lauryn Burleigh. I am the creator of the Between The Lobes site. I have a border-collie/lab mix named Roxy and an american pitbull terrier named Bronson, who are both pictured above. I also have two rabbits, Cal and Moo.
I am a graduate student in Dr. Steven Greening’s Cognitive Neuroscience of Affect and Psychopathology Lab (CNAPs Lab) at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA.</description>
