      <description>My name is Lauryn Burleigh. I am the creator of the Between The Lobes site. I have a Border-Collie/Lab mix named Roxy and an American Pitbull Terrier named Bronson, who are both pictured above. I also have two rabbits, Cal and Moo.
I am a graduate student in Dr. Steven Greening’s Cognitive Neuroscience of Affect and Psychopathology Lab (CNAPs Lab) at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. I am interested in emotions and how they impact cognitive processes.</description>
